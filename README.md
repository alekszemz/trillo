# trillo
<p>It is a fictional all-in-one booking app template that allows users to book a variety of travel-related services all in one platform. I built this template while learning the <strong>"Advanced CSS and Sass"</strong> course from Jonas Schmedtmann on the Udemy learning platform.</p>
<p>The app allows users to book a hotel, a flight, a car, and a tour all in one place. The goal of the project was to use as many CSS grid layouts as possible to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design.</p>
